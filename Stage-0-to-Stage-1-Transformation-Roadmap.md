# **MATURITY TRANSFORMATION ROADMAP: STAGE 0 → STAGE 1**
## **Professional Services Transformation for Retirement Firms with Wealth Management**

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Your organization is embarking on a critical transformation journey. Research shows that organizations stuck at Stage 0 (Ad-Hoc) suffer from chaotic operations, hero-dependent processes, and significantly lower performance. Moving to Stage 1 (Defined/Managed) establishes the **foundational discipline** needed for all future maturity advances.

**Key Insight**: Stage 1 is about moving from **chaos to consistency** — establishing common definitions, basic processes, and accountability frameworks. Only 22% of companies have formal Marketing-Sales SLAs in place, meaning most organizations remain in Stage 0.

**Critical Success Factor**: All 5 workstreams must advance together. The recommended sequence prioritizes **foundational capabilities** (CRM and Analytics) before scaling operational workstreams.

---

## **THE 5 WORKSTREAMS**

1. **Lead Best Practices (Lead Management)** - Marketing-to-Sales handoff, lead qualification, and follow-up
2. **Measurement & Reporting (Analytics)** - Data integration, reporting infrastructure, and metrics
3. **Practice Management (Professional Services Operations)** - Delivery operations, resource management, and project execution
4. **Salesforce CRM / User Experience** - System adoption, data quality, and user interface
5. **Lead Creation (Demand Generation)** - Marketing programs, content creation, and campaign execution

---

## **WORKSTREAM 1: LEAD BEST PRACTICES (LEAD MANAGEMENT)**

### **STAGE 0: Current State (Ad-Hoc)**
- Marketing and Sales operate in silos with mutual distrust
- No formal MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead) or SQL (Sales Qualified Lead) definitions
- Lead response times slow and inconsistent (often >24 hours vs. best practice of <5 minutes)
- No Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between Marketing and Sales
- Only 27% of leads are actually contacted by sales teams
- Success depends on individual "heroes" tracking their own leads

### **STAGE 1: Defined**
Common terminology agreed upon; basic lead processes documented with initial SLAs

---

### **TASKS TO MOVE FROM STAGE 0 → STAGE 1**

#### **A. Entry Criteria/Prerequisites**
- ✅ Basic lead capture system exists (CRM or database)
- ✅ Marketing and Sales leadership willing to collaborate
- ✅ **DEPENDENCY**: Workstream 4 (CRM) at minimum Stage 1 to log leads
- ✅ Some historical lead data available for analysis
- ✅ No major unresolved conflict between departments

#### **B. Detailed Activities & Deliverables**

| **Task** | **Deliverable** | **Timeline** |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Define MQL & SQL criteria | Lead Qualification Matrix document | Weeks 1-4 |

| Establish Marketing-Sales SLA | Signed SLA document (e.g., 24-hour response time) | Weeks 5-8 |
| Design speed-to-lead protocol | Documented response process with notifications | Weeks 6-8 |
| Create initial lead scoring model | Lead Scoring Matrix (rule-based, simple) | Weeks 7-10 |
| Conduct joint training | Training materials and workshops | Weeks 9-10 |
| Set up governance meetings | Bi-weekly Lead Review meeting cadence | Week 10 |

#### **C. Resource Requirements**

| **Resource Type** | **Allocation** | **Duration** |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Marketing Operations Manager | 0.5 FTE | 2 months |
| Sales Operations Manager | 0.5 FTE | 2 months |
| CRM Administrator | 0.2 FTE | 2 months |

**Budget**: Minimal (<$10K for facilitation/consulting if needed)
**Timeline**: **8-12 weeks** (add 2 weeks for compliance review in banking)

#### **D. Success Metrics & Exit Criteria**

| **Metric** | **Target** |
|------------|------------|
| SLA adoption rate | >80% of MQLs contacted within 24 hours |
| MQL-to-SQL acceptance | >70% of MQLs accepted by Sales |
| Lead vocabulary adoption | Both teams use MQL/SQL terminology consistently |
| Pipeline increase | Measurable increase in qualified opportunities |
| Contact rate improvement | Any improvement vs. baseline (moving toward 21× advantage) |

**Exit Criteria**: Formal SLA signed, shared vocabulary in use, at least one review cycle completed with data-driven adjustments

#### **E. Risk Factors & Mitigation**

| **Risk** | **Likelihood** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Sales resistance ("leads are still junk") | **HIGH** | Involve respected sales reps in design; show ROI data |
| Marketing reluctance to raise quality bar | **MEDIUM** | Reset KPIs from volume to quality (MQL-to-SQL conversion) |
| CRM system limitations | **MEDIUM** | Validate CRM capabilities early; upgrade if needed |
| Insufficient executive support | **MEDIUM** | Secure CMO and Head of Sales co-sponsorship |
| Compliance delays (banking) | **MEDIUM** | Engage Compliance early on privacy/contact rules |

#### **F. Banking-Specific Considerations**
- Compliance checks for lead contact (GLBA opt-out rules, TCPA for phone/text)
- Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements may slow initial contact
- Existing customer context must be integrated (mortgage lead may be existing checking customer)
- Privacy notices must cover use of data for lead qualification
- OCC operational risk guidelines should inform process design

#### **F. Banking-Specific Considerations**
- Data privacy regulations (GLBA, CCPA, state laws) limit some data uses
- Federal Reserve expectations for model validation if building predictive models
- Separation of retail banking data from wealth management (Chinese walls)
- Legacy core banking systems may have difficult/expensive integration
- Data residency requirements for certain customer data

### **STAGE 1: Functional**
Core processes become repeatable within functions; still somewhat siloed but documented

---

### **TASKS TO MOVE FROM STAGE 0 → STAGE 1**

#### **A. Entry Criteria/Prerequisites**
- ✅ Executive recognition that hero-dependence is unsustainable
- ✅ Willingness to document and standardize processes

**Budget**: $30K-$75K (external facilitation, process consulting, tools)
**Timeline**: **12-16 weeks** (cultural change extends beyond this)

#### **D. Success Metrics & Exit Criteria**

| **Metric** | **Target** |
|------------|------------|

| Inadequate executive support | **MEDIUM** | Secure executive sponsorship with visible commitment |
| "This won't work for us" syndrome | **HIGH** | Customize processes to firm culture; pilot with willing team first |

#### **F. Banking/Wealth Management-Specific Considerations**
- Wealth management requires high-touch, relationship-driven service (balance standardization with personalization)
- Regulatory examinations require documented, repeatable processes
- Client confidentiality/privacy critical in all process documentation
- Cross-selling between retirement and wealth services requires coordination
- Fiduciary duty standards require process rigor

## **WORKSTREAM 5: LEAD CREATION (DEMAND GENERATION)**

### **STAGE 0: Current State (Unresponsive)**
- No dedicated marketing resources
- "Random acts of marketing" with no strategy
- Reactive to competitor actions or client requests
- No consistent brand presence
- 61% of B2B marketers cite generating quality leads as biggest challenge

### **STAGE 1: Active**
Basic marketing tools (email lists, simple campaigns); one person driving efforts; still largely reactive

---

### **TASKS TO MOVE FROM STAGE 0 → STAGE 1**

#### **A. Entry Criteria/Prerequisites**
- ✅ Budget allocated for marketing (even if modest)
- ✅ At least one marketing resource (full or part-time)
- ✅ Basic brand assets exist (logo, messaging, website)

|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Marketing hire doesn't work out | **MEDIUM** | Clear job description; trial period; mentorship/coaching |
| Lead quality poor (79% of leads never convert) | **HIGH** | **DO NOT SCALE YET** — wait for Workstream 1 (Lead Mgmt) to reach Stage 1 |
| Inconsistent execution (bandwidth issues) | **HIGH** | Start small; use templates; consider agency support |
| Sales doesn't value marketing leads | **HIGH** | Tight alignment from start; involve sales in persona/messaging |
| Insufficient budget | **MEDIUM** | Prioritize low-cost tactics (content, email) over paid advertising |

#### **F. Banking/Wealth Management-Specific Considerations**
- Highly regulated marketing (FINRA, SEC, state regulations for retirement/investment products)
- All marketing materials may require compliance review before publication
- Fair lending and fair advertising rules apply
- Privacy regulations limit use of customer data for marketing
- Conservative brand positioning expected by retirement clients
- Fiduciary messaging and disclosures required
- Reputation risk is high — errors can damage client trust

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT aggressively scale Lead Creation (Stage 1→2) until Workstream 1 (Lead Management) reaches Stage 1. Otherwise, you create the "leaky bucket" problem — generating leads that aren't contacted (70% waste per Forbes).

## **CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES & SEQUENCING**

### **Recommended Advancement Sequence**

The research is clear: **attempting to advance all workstreams simultaneously will fail**. Here's the optimal sequence:

#### **PHASE 1: Foundation (Months 1-4)**
**Priority**: Establish infrastructure that enables everything else

```
1. Workstream 4 (CRM/UX) → Stage 1
   └─ Dependency: None (this is the foundation)
   └─ Why First: CRM is prerequisite for Lead Management, Analytics, and Lead Creation

2. Workstream 2 (Analytics) → Stage 1
   └─ Dependency: CRM at Stage 1 (need data to analyze)
   └─ Why Second: Measurement enables optimization of all other workstreams
```

#### **PHASE 2: Parallel Tracks (Months 3-6)**
**Priority**: Build operational capabilities

```
3A. Workstream 1 (Lead Management) → Stage 1
    └─ Dependencies: CRM at Stage 1, Analytics at Stage 1 (helpful but not required)
    └─ Why Now: Must establish lead handling before scaling generation

3B. Workstream 3 (Practice Management) → Stage 1
    └─ Dependencies: CRM at Stage 1 (for project/resource visibility)
    └─ Why Parallel: Can progress independently of lead workstreams
```

#### **PHASE 3: Demand Generation (Months 5-7)**
**Priority**: Scale lead volume ONLY after handling is ready

```
4. Workstream 5 (Lead Creation) → Stage 1
   └─ Dependencies: CRM at Stage 1, Lead Management at Stage 1
   └─ Why Last: "Optimize before you amplify" — fix conversion before scaling volume
```

### **Visual Dependency Map**

```
CRM/UX (WS4) ──┬──→ Lead Management (WS1) ──→ Lead Creation (WS5)
               │                              ↑
               ├──→ Analytics (WS2) ──────────┘
               │         ↓
               └──→ Practice Management (WS3)
```

## **RISK-CREATING MISALIGNMENTS TO AVOID**

| **Misalignment** | **Risk** | **Warning Indicator** | **Fix** |
|------------------|----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Lead Creation far ahead of Lead Management** | "Leaky bucket" — 70% of leads wasted | MQL→SQL conversion <13%; high lead rejection | PAUSE lead gen scaling until lead mgmt processes work |
| **CRM behind all others** | Blind operations; incomplete data | Sales using spreadsheets; low CRM adoption | Stop other initiatives; fix CRM first |
| **Analytics behind all others** | Cannot validate if anything is working | No closed-loop reporting; decisions by opinion not data | Implement basic dashboards before next phase |
| **Practice Management lagging** | Can't deliver what sales sells | Margin surprises; utilization variance; burnout | Document processes; resource visibility |
| **Advancing multiple to Stage 2+ before all reach Stage 1** | Systemic dysfunction | One area optimized but bottlenecked by immature dependency | Get all to Stage 1 before any go to Stage 2 |

## **CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS**

Moving from Stage 0 (Ad-Hoc) to Stage 1 (Defined/Managed) is the **most critical transformation phase**. Research shows:

- ✅ Only 22% of companies have achieved this level of Marketing-Sales alignment
- ✅ Companies with Stage 1 capabilities are **3× more likely to be effective** and see **34% higher ROI**
- ⚠️ But **70% of transformations fail**, usually due to cultural resistance, poor sequencing, or insufficient executive support

### **Success Factors**
1. **Sequence properly**: CRM & Analytics first, then Lead Management & Practice Management, finally Lead Creation
2. **Change incentives before processes**: Especially for Practice Management (hero to functional)
3. **Executive sponsorship visible**: Leaders must model the new behaviors
4. **Start small, prove value**: Pilots before enterprise rollout
5. **Celebrate quick wins**: Build momentum and overcome skepticism

### **Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)**
1. ✅ Secure executive sponsor (CEO or COO) commitment
2. ✅ Form Steering Committee and Transformation Working Group
3. ✅ Conduct current state assessment (validate Stage 0 assumption)
4. ✅ Allocate initial FTEs (at minimum: Salesforce Admin, Data Engineer, Transformation Lead)
5. ✅ Approve Phase 1 budget ($90K-$250K for CRM + Analytics foundation)
6. ✅ Identify Workstream 4 and 2 leads
7. ✅ Schedule kickoff meeting for Phase 1 (Month 1, Week 1)
