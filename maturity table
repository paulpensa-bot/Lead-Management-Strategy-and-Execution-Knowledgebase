### Stage 2: Operationally Consistent
Processes are enforced with SLAs, basic automation begins, cross-channel alignment established, and governance introduced.

### Stage 3: Enterprise Integrated
Standardized workflows across all channels, unified systems, comprehensive measurement, and enterprise-wide governance.

### Stage 4: Quantitatively Managed
Automated workflows with AI assistance, predictive analytics, real-time measurement, and data-driven decision making.

### Stage 5: Self-Optimizing
Autonomous systems that learn and adapt, prescriptive analytics, continuous improvement embedded, and intelligent orchestration.

## Dependencies Across Workstreams

Each workstream has interdependencies:
- **Strategy & Execution** depends on CRM enhancements and measurement capabilities
- **Lead Creation** requires CRM validation and routing policies
- **CRM Enhancements** enable both strategy execution and measurement
- **Measurement & Reporting** supports all other workstreams with insights
- **Practice Management** depends on measurement systems and CRM adoption

Advancement should be coordinated across workstreams to maintain balance and avoid bottlenecks.
